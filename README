Custom heap allocator with dynamic memory pools.

This is not meant for production-grade applications.
YAGNI and KISS principles were followed in this project.

Features:
  - mmap-based memory pools (min 1MB)
  - Best-fit allocation strategy
  - Block splitting and coalescing
  - Thread-safe using pthread mutex
  - 8-byte alignment for performance

Build:
  $ cmake 
  $ make

How to use
use LD_PRELOAD to load valloc
